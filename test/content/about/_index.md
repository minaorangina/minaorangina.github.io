![This is me][1]

I love writing tutorials. I wrote the Node.js coding materials that we use at Node Girls.

They really helped me when I was learning, so my way of giving back. 

I want to make sure that anyone who wants to learn to code has access to some good quality learning materials that aren't complicated and don't bore you to death.

Though I've #madeit and am working as a software engineer, I never stop learning.  May as well share my journey with you to save you the trouble.

I am always up for chatting about anything I write here on Twitter, questions, comments, whatever :)
