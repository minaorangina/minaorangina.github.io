I'm Mina. 👋🏾

I want to make sure that anyone who wants to learn to code has access to some good quality learning materials that aren't complicated and don't bore you to death.

Though I'm now working as a software engineer, I never stop learning.  I'll share any interesting things I pick up along the way.

I am always up for chatting about anything I write here on Twitter, questions, comments, whatever :)
